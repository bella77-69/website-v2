              Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and
              applications is truly a passion of mine. This industry appeals to
              me because it's some of the most rewarding and challenging work
              I've ever done! I love bringing concepts to life through code. I
              am seeking projects as a web developer to maximize the value I can
              bring to end-users in todayâ€™s digital world. I look forward to
              being continuously challenged and learning new things every day.

              Apart from coding all day and night, I enjoy reading, watching
              Hockey, movies, and I also enjoy plants. I am currently running
              out of window ledges!
